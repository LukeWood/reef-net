# KerasCV RetinaNet

I've been working on a RetinaNet implementation for KerasCV [(see KerasCV PR #609)](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv/pull/609).
I've been struggling to score well on the PascalVOC dataset, so I've written some training scripts in this repo to replicate the original ReefNet results.
